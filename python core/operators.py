# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Arithmetic operators(+-*/%**)
# +	Addition
# print(1+1)
# -	Subtraction
# print(3-2)
# *	Multiplication
# print(2*5)
# print('name '*20)
# /	Division
# print(4/2)
# %	Modulus
# print(4 % 3)
# **Exponentiation
# print(2**2)
# //Floor division
# print(5//2)



# Assignment operators
# These operators are used to assign values to variables
# country = 'Nigeria'

# Comparison operators
# are used to compare two values:
# ==	Equal
a = 2
b = 5
# print(a == b)
# !=	Not equal
# print(a != b)
# >	 Greater than
print(a > b)
# <	Less than
print(a < b)
# >= Greater than or equal to
print(a >= b)
# <=	Less than or equal to
print(a <= b)
# Logical operators
# are used to combine conditional statements
if a < b and a == b:
    print('correct')
else:
    print('program fail')

# Identity operators

# Membership operators

# Bitwise operators
